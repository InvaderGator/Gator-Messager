# Gator-Messager

## You need to edit code to use this bot.
The way the bot works is that it is hardwired to respond to channel IDs (CIDs) and user IDs (UIDs)
You will need to change code in the python script to respond to the .env file.

There is a /say command for users to spread their will across discord channels
There is a complementary saylock and ban command too so users can't as well

## .JSON
The .JSON files are used to write and save data for the bot. This is the banlist and the saylock saving.

**If you don't want the bot to spew ephermal/private command messages to a private-dm channel, then ban the bot through the /adminban command.**

<hr>

## You need <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python3</a> for this script.

## **Install <a href="https://pycord.dev/">py-cord</a> or <a href="https://discordpy-reborn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">discord.py</a> and also install dotenv from pip**
#### MAKE SURE YOU INSTALL 'py-cord' NOT 'pycord'</span>
They're two seperate packages.

# Replace information in the .env file
## You need your discord bot's token, Channel IDs, and User IDs.
