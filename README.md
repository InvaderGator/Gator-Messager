# Gator-Messager

## You need to edit code to use this bot.
The way the bot works is that it is hardwired to respond to channel IDs (CIDs) and user IDs (UIDs)
You will need to change code in the python script to respond to the .env file.

<hr>

## You need <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python3</a> for this script.

## **Install <a href="https://pycord.dev/">py-cord</a> or <a href="https://discordpy-reborn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">discord.py</a> and also install dotenv from pip**
#### MAKE SURE YOU INSTALL 'py-cord' NOT 'pycord'</span>
They're two seperate packages.

<hr>

# Replace information in the .env file
## You need your discord bot's token, Channel IDs, and User IDs.
